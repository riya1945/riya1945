🌟 **About Me**

I’m Riya Joshi, a 20-year-old tech explorer currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science with a passion for Artificial Intelligence and smart applications. I'm drawn to the idea of building systems that **don’t just respond — they think, adapt, and evolve**.

My work spans from intelligent dashboards and user behavior models to goal-tracking platforms and personal productivity tools — all powered by thoughtful design and real-world relevance.

Driven by a constant desire to learn and innovate, I love blending **engineering logic** with **creative intuition**. Whether it’s deploying ML models or designing seamless UIs, I aim to make tech both smart and human-centered.

📌 Constantly experimenting, always iterating — because progress lives in motion.
